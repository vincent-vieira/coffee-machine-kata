# Coffee machine Kata [![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/vincent-vieira/coffee-machine-kata.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/vincent-vieira/coffee-machine-kata)

##Â About the project
This project is my own implementation of the [Coffee Machine Kata](http://simcap.github.io/coffeemachine).
It is made for Java8, with seamless integration with [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) in order to validate changes made on the develop branch.

## About my development methods
This project follow the [Git flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) methodology.
Each iteration is represented by a Git branch issued from and merged inside the *develop* branch when all the work is finished and the feature has been fully tested.
Commit messages follow the AngularJS commit messages guidelines in order to be precise, clear and changelog-friendly.
